Stacking Classifier for Improved Model Accuracy
This project demonstrates the implementation of a Stacking Classifier, an ensemble learning technique that combines multiple classification models to improve predictive performance. By leveraging the strengths of various base learners and a meta-classifier, the model aims to reduce bias and variance compared to individual models.

📌 Key Highlights
Objective: Enhance classification accuracy using stacking ensemble strategy.

Base Models:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Meta Classifier:

Logistic Regression (trained on outputs of base models)

Data Processing:

StandardScaler for normalization

Train/test split

Evaluation Metrics:

Accuracy

Classification Report

Confusion Matrix

📊 Dataset
A synthetic dataset is used with two informative features and one redundant feature.

Generated using make_classification from sklearn.datasets.

⚙️ Tools & Libraries
Python

scikit-learn

matplotlib

seaborn

📈 Results
Stacking classifier outperformed individual base models.

Visualizations include confusion matrices and performance comparisons.
